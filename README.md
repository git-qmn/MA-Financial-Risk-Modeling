# Valuing M&A Targets using Financial Models

## Overview
This project evaluates a potential M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) target using three fundamental valuation methods: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), EBITDA Multiples, and Leveraged Buyout (LBO). These models provide different perspectives on business valuation, helping stakeholders make informed acquisition decisions.

## Files Included
- `Value M&A Target using DCF.ipynb` – Valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow model.
- `Value M&A Target using EBITDA Multiples.ipynb` – Valuation using comparable EBITDA multiples.
- `Value M&A Target using LBO.ipynb` – Valuation using a Leveraged Buyout model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/git-qmn/MA-Financial-Risk-Modeling.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage
- Each notebook is self-contained. Open and execute the cells step-by-step.
- Adjust assumptions (e.g., discount rates, growth rates, leverage) to explore valuation sensitivity.

## Methodology
- **DCF Model**: Projects free cash flows and discounts them to present value using WACC.
- **EBITDA Multiples**: Applies comparable company valuation multiples to estimated EBITDA.
- **LBO Model**: Builds a capital structure with debt assumptions and calculates IRR over exit scenarios.

## Key Insights
- The models offer complementary views—DCF emphasizes intrinsic value, EBITDA multiples capture market benchmarks, and LBO focuses on return potential from a financial buyer’s perspective.
